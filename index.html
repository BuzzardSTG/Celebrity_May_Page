            Brian Harold May CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician,
            singer, songwriter, and astrophysicist who achieved fame as lead
            guitarist of the rock band Queen. May was a co-founder of Queen with
            lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor. His
            songwriting contributions helped Queen become one of the most
            successful bands in rock history.<br /><br />
            May previously performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had
            joined while he was at university. After Queen's formation in 1970,
            bass player John Deacon joined to complete the line-up in 1971. They
            became one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success
            of the album A Night at the Opera and its single "Bohemian
            Rhapsody". <br /><br />
            From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen played at some of
            the biggest venues in the world, including at Live Aid in 1985. As a
            member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician. He was
            identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered
            guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the Red
            Special. May wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "We Will Rock
            You", "I Want It All", "Fat Bottomed Girls", "Flash", "Hammer to
            Fall", "Save Me", "Who Wants to Live Forever", "Too Much Love Will
            Kill You", and "The Show Must Go On".
